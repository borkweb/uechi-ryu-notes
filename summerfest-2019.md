# Summer Fest 2019 notes from sessions

Key notes/takeaways from the 2019 Summer Fest

## Instructor Training Sessions

### Instructor Training 1 - George Mattson (10th Dan)

Keep the kata movement fluid. Always remain in motion. You lose efficiency of motion when you have abrupt stops.

### Instructor Training 2 - Neil Stone (8th Dan)

Notable drills:

* Kanshiwa bunkai laterally across the floor with a partner. No turning, just a series of attacks from one opponent.
* Seisan bunkai street style w/ a partner. I found this one quite difficult, which goes to show my lack of experience/comfort with Seisan Bunkai.

Teaching note: Keep a momentum of activities and challenging concepts to force folks to exercise their brain and make connections.

### Instructor Training 3 - Marcus Traynor (7th Dan)

When instructing, use visual cues, touch, and clear direction. Example:

* Say "left foot forward" and point at their left foot (and mirror them)
* Say "hands up" and put your hands up.
* Say "now, you are going to step forward with your right foot" and point at their right foot
* Say "and you'll punch with you right" and tap their arm with TWO FINGERS (a full hand tap–when working rapidly can accidentally be turned into a slap) and then tap on yourself where you want their punch to land.

You can beckon folks forward with making a motion on the side of the body you wish them to advance or retreat with. Right hand beckoning forward means advance the right foot. Pushing back motion with your left means push back. You can employ these words and motions to get a student to do something they haven't done. Subtract cues to ensure they are getting it. If they struggle, just add the cues back.

### Instructor Training 4 - Buzz Durkin (10th Dan)

Emphasize non-physical attributes of karate to instill a life change. Karate is more than an outlet for exercise, and if you present it as the life enriching thing that it is, folks are more likely to keep coming back.

### Instructor Training 5 - Christine Bannon-Rodrigues (Kempo)

"Sesei Says" is a fun game to play with folks. Give a series of strikes for a drill and if anyone flinches or strikes when you don't say Sensei Says, then they fail that round. Rather than eliminating folks, failure is a series of pushups (maybe 1-5). Eliminating elimination keeps folks from feeling like a total failure while also allowing folks to continue to practice/drill.

## Friday Regular Sessions

### John Cieri (10th Dan)

Kanshiwa, as you turn, the circle block arm goes down to deflect a potential kick while the other arm is a check block. Circle block arm then comes up to control. We practiced doing those with the first 5 moves of Kanshiwa. We then did a similar block as we pivoted to th eback. The key is to check first and the circle block controls and pulls (into Sanchin) to open opponent to a strike.

### James Thompson (10th Dan)

_Hip Rotation:_ Left sanchin. The question was, which punch can reach farther, the jab or the cross? The answer is the cross if you use proper hip rotation! THe key is the hip tuck and rotation, allowing the cross to strike beyond that of the jab.

_Hot punch:_ Lose strike with a last minute tightening and allow your fist to form across the impact area. Push through the target. Before going into the strike demonstration, we practiced the depth by standing with our cross strike fist against the opponent's pec and just rotated our hip to push through them.

### Bob Bethany (10th Dan)

Go before he goes! The session centered around seeing a strike and striking immediately toward your opponent.

After the session, I approached Mr. Bethany and asked about identifying attacks, mentioning that I felt slow. Mr. Bethany said to focus on solving my own tells and in doing so I would learn what tells to look for in my opponents and how to use them. Also, experience and many opponents help immensely.

### Darin Yee (9th Dan)

"Anything straight is hard. Anything circular is soft"

## Saturday Morning Sessions

### Tracy Rose (9th Dan)

This wasn't a session, but I talked to Mr. Rose before we started. These are his (very paraphrased) words:

> I always ask students why. Why do you do something a certain way? The style wasn't meant to stagnate, but sometimes we find ourselves repeating things that worked years ago and not adapting it for ourselves and our own bodies. Instead, we need to learn the basics and keep those in mind as we move into position for striking. Example: Arm in Sanchin at a specific position...why do some people move their arms out of sanchin to intercept strikes? Stay in Sanchin and move hips with rotation to minimize the distance your striking/defensive arms are from your potential targets.

### Allan Azoff (8th Dan)

Receiving a punch similar to kanshiwa bunkai–block high on their arm, pin their arm under your armpit with other arm coming up to the shoulder to force an arm bar.

### Warren Chaile (10th Dan) and David Kelley (9th Dan)

Master Chaile came up with a technique to ensure your sanchin strike is aimed and lands consistently in the right spot. That technique is: Pull arm back for the sanchin strike (forearm level with the floor) and bring your elbow down ever so slightly so that the strike is aimed to rise to the correct position.

Mr. Kelley discussed that at our ranks, the circle blocks should start to look more like a spiral, coming forward as you block.

Mr. Kelley showed a technique for getting out of a choke from the front (2 hands on neck). He showed the use of fishtails on the inside of the grab on the forearms of the attacker–right hand hitting the opponent's right forearm then striking back at their left forearm, and then following up with a strike to the throat/nose.

### Paul Trickett (8th Dan)

Seisan jump back...don't go for distance. Land on the ball of your foot. Practice kata at ludicrous speed to see where you struggle. More often than not it is in the footwork and balance. By doing that, you can focus your attention to your weakest link.

### Tyler Rose (Unsure of rank)

1. Arms in sanchin. Receive a punch with a rotation of the hips and a J-step. The rotation with the sanchin arms traps the strike and it can turn into an arm bar.
2. Sanchin stepping in reverse with the J-Step. Distribute weight between your feet and the fore foot is more of a cat stance. This allows you to have better reactive movement. Do NOT move laterally when receiving strikes...that's a sure way to eat a punch.

### Dan Dovidio (9th Dan)

1. Grab from opponents. Arm bends are important. Imagine a single hand grabbing the shirt. Use both of your hands to flatten their hand against your body and rotate your hips and sink down to force them down to the ground.
1. Grab from side onto arm (sleeve). Move your grabbed arm like our deep breathing exercise and come up from behind their arm and pull/rake your arm down to their elbow, pulling your arm close to your body (like the welcome sign in American Sign Language).

## Saturday Afternoon Sessions

### Christine Bannon-Rodrigues (Kempo)

We worked kempo striking drills and gave them numbers. 1) Jab toward the head then cross to the chest as you move forward. 2) Side kick to the gut and cross to the chest as you move forward. 3) High block and drop low to strike the abdomen while you remain in place.

Mrs BR discussed how she uses her side kick as her jab, but rather than lifting the knee up to chamber and then kicking, she aims her foot in the direction she wishes to strike and then strikes hard. It doesn't matter where you hit exactly–arms, stomach, chest, etc because the strike is hard.

### Tracy Rose (9th Dan)

Mr. Rose talked about distributing weight across the feat. About a cat stance with the front leg or the back leg as a way to shift weight around. He was clear about keeping the belt facing your opponent–well, he said to me and my partner: "Point your dicks at eachother!" He showed receiving low punches like "driving the bus" in Seichin while using the foot movements you should be using in Dan Kumite–deflect low and step toward your opponent at a 45 degree angle, keeping your belt toward them. Get close and have your blocking hand come under and into their ribcage or toward their neck. The key thing is to ALWAYS be moving and keep the momentum going with strikes and shifting your weight.

### Raffi Derderian (7th Dan) - Jeet Kun Do

We worked some trapping motions.

1. Opponent strikes with right, you receive it with your right, keeping your arm in sanchin. Your left slaps/grabs down on their striking arm and your right hand rises to punch their face. They check block that with their left and your left comes up to strike their face. Then your left slaps down at their left arm as your right hand rises to strike their face.

We worked the early stages of that drill and worked our way up the the full drill.

### Darin Yee (9th Dan)

This session started out with Mr. Yee telling us how he started training in Uechi Ryu. He had studdied Praying Mantis Kung Fu and White Crane Kung Fu. He heard about the Mattson Academy and went to check it out. They had him show one of his kung fu forms–it had flowery movements and elaborate poses. Then Bob Campbell showed his San Seiryu. Darin Yee thought the form sucked. Then Bob Campbell asked if Darin Yee could fight and Mr. Yee said of course. Bob Campbell then proceeded to beat Darin Yee from one side of the dojo to the other. Mr. Yee then asked if Bob Campbell could teach him how to fight like that and then Mr. Campbell asked if Mr. Yee would study Uechi Ryu. The rest is history! (Now he's the president of the IUKF)

Mr. Yee said that Uechi Ryu is the most effective and direct style he has studied and that combat in the Uechi Ryu style is incredibly potent and possible. Praying Mantis fight like Praying Mantis, White crane fight in the white crane style. Why don't we see many Uechi practitioners fight in the Uechi style using Uechi techniques at our lower ranks? So, he focused on our Sanchin to begin with:

1. First Sanchin, we did it normally, with _hard_ sanchin strikes
2. Next, we kept our fists tight and punched as hard as we could in place of the standard sanchin strike
3. Next, we did the sanchin but we stepped through deeply and struck at the same time.

Then we moved on to the wauke motion and its 6 blocks hidden within (as Darin Yee identifies them). First, Mr. Yee asked how you bring your hand down to do the wauke block. I said straight down and he asked why. I postulated that it could be a block. He then asked how often someone would strike to the outside of your gut? He then discussed how _he_ brings his hand down–noting that there aren't any wasted movements in Uechi Ryu. He brings his hand out in a check block, then circling down to a low block/deflection. Then the other arm comes across as a check block. THen the wauke arm comes across and blocks low with almost a fish-tail. Then the block circles up to circle block and the other hand comes out into some semblance of a circle block. That's the 6 blocks.

Then we worked them.

1. Opponent comes in _hard_ at your chest with the right and you check block with the left. Then the other side.
2. Opponent comes in _hard_ at your midsection with the right and you deflect down with your right in sort of a scoop.
3. Opponent comes in _hard_ at your midsection with the right and you fishtail across (and low) to deflect
4. Opponent comes in _hard_ at your chest with the right and you check with your right

Then we ran out of time.

### Ed Melaugh (Small Circle Juijutsu)

1. Someone grabs your left wrist with their right hand. You rotate your hand down into a fist like you are hitch hiking and rotate your wrist (and thumb) around ontop of their wrist as your right hand traps their right ontop of your wrist. Then you bend their elbow and force them down–they'll tap out.
1. Someone grabs your shirt. Turn your shoulder so that it hits against their arm, which leaves their thumb exposed. Press into their thumb–forcing the first knuckle into their palm. It is quite painful.
1. Someone grabs your shirt with both hands. Slide an arm up through the middle to about your forearm and then lift your elbow. You can then grab their thumb like in the previous drill.
